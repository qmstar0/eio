</div>



eio is a Go library inspired by Watermill.
In comparison to Watermill, eio focuses on providing the most essential and versatile functionalities.
The code is more streamlined to ensure better scalability and usability.
By simplifying the interface and enhancing flexibility, it becomes more easily integrable into various projects.
More complex usage scenarios should be designed by developers.
This way, developers can more effortlessly leverage eio to build small to medium-sized event-driven applications.

This is an ongoing project, and many APIs may still be unstable, subject to frequent updates. Please take note of the following:

- **Instability:** The project is still in development, and some APIs may undergo frequent changes. Therefore, please check the release notes carefully when upgrading versions.

- **Feedback and Contributions:** We welcome your feedback and contributions. If you encounter issues or have improvement suggestions, please raise them in the [Issue](https://github.com/qmstar0/eio/issues) section.

- **Documentation:** As the project continues to evolve, the documentation may not be exhaustive. If you find any unclear points in the documentation, please let us know, and we will strive to improve it.

Thank you for your interest and support in our project!

## Goals

* **Concise**, **user-friendly**, and **reliable**.
* It only provides **basic** and **general** functionalities, leaving more specialized scenarios to be implemented by developers.
* As a **package**, it seamlessly integrates into your project rather than imposing itself as a rigid framework.

## TODO

- [ ] Fix the problem of occasional deadlock in `Router`

## What is a watermill?

> Watermill is a Go library for working efficiently with message streams. It is intended for building event
> driven applications, enabling event sourcing, RPC over messages, sagas and basically whatever else comes to
> your mind. You can use conventional pub/sub implementations like Kafka or RabbitMQ, but also HTTP or
> MySQL binlog if that fits your use case.

### Why not use Watermill directly and instead choose to develop a project with similar functionality?

Watermill is an excellent event-driven library. When I first encountered Watermill, it felt like discovering a treasure ðŸ¤©.
However, during the actual usage, I gradually discovered various mismatches between Watermill and my project.
Many features in Watermill were not suitable for my project, and due to its complexity, I couldn't encapsulate it (due to my limited experience).
If I continued using Watermill, my project would be tightly coupled with it and difficult to separate. Therefore,
to ensure outstanding scalability for my personal project, I decided to abandon the use of Watermill. Instead,
I extracted its core and most universal functionalities, made modifications, and thus created the current eio.
