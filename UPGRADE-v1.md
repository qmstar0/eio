# Official Release of eio! (v1.0.0)

Hello everyone!

I am thrilled to announce the official release of the `eio` (event io) library!
`eio` is a Go event-driven library inspired by Watermill. Unlike Watermill,
`eio` focuses more on providing the most essential and versatile functionalities to ensure better scalability and usability.

While `eio` may still have some room for improvement, I believe that with continuous effort and feedback from the community,
it will become stronger over time.

## Some Highlights

- **Concise**, **User-friendly**, **Reliable**: The design philosophy of `eio` is concise, user-friendly, and reliable.

- **Basic Functionality**: It provides basic and general functionalities, making it easier to integrate into various projects.

- **Adaptability**: eio is more adaptable, allowing developers to design more complex usage scenarios based on specific project requirements.

## Thanks to Watermill

The birth of `eio` was inspired by Watermill, which was a valuable experience. During actual usage,
I gradually discovered mismatches between Watermill and my project. Therefore, to ensure outstanding scalability for my personal project,
I decided to extract the core functionalities of Watermill, make modifications, and thus created `eio`.

Feel free to try out `eio`, provide feedback, and suggest improvements. I believe that through community effort, eio will continue to evolve into a powerful and flexible event-driven library.

## Final Note

I hereby announce the official release of `eio`. I hope it becomes an indispensable part of your event-driven applications. Your participation and support are greatly appreciated!
